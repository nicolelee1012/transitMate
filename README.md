# transitMate 

This mobile app was developed using React Native as a project for a class called CS 147 (Introduction to Human-Computer Interaction design). Throughout the 10 weeks, students formed a group of 4 consisting of designers, project managers, and developers to create their app. We began by needfinding through interviews and market research. We then iterated through low-fidelity (balasmiq), medium-fidelity (figma), and high-fidelity prototypes (React Native), improving each prototype using our peers' and instructors' feedback. As the main developer of the group, I was in charge of a large part of the app during the last 2 weeks of the course when we were creating the high-fi prototype. 

The app was built to satisfy the course goals - creating a rapid prototype with thorough testing. Due to the tight timeline, app is not complete yet. As the class was mainly focused on frontend, we did not implant any backend. Additionally, we were not required to implement user authentication. Therefore, there are some features that are hardcoded. 

 In the coming weeks, we plan on expanding our app to be able to be launched in the app store. Our plans for expansion is 
  1. implement backend 
  2. implement user authentication and syncing with their phones 
  3. make every part consistent in design
  4. conduct more thorough user research to gain feedback on UI/UX
